ab1 pathway is N meters long and Raju walks at a speed of S meters per Minute.
(Note the Greatest Common Divisor of N and S is always equal to S )
There are X people in the pathway walking in the same direction as Raju each of them slows him down by Ai seconds. 
Raju has a lenient teacher who gives attendance to all students who come less than equal to L minutes late.

Input Format
The first line contains 4 integers N S X L The second line contains X space separated 
integers the values the time wasted to cross person Ai

Constraints
